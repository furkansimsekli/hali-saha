# ⚽ Halı Saha

> Turkish for “where washed-up tech bros roleplay as athletes.”  
> Also known as: distributed denial-of-service on my hamstrings.

## 🤔 Why?
Because I kept missing halı saha matches like an idiot. Group chat
drops the message, 10 nerds pile in, slots fill up, and I'm left
fake-laughing at memes instead of playing defense. This bot watches
WhatsApp like a hawk on Adderall and signs you up before the other
mortals even blink.

## 💻 What is this?
A scuffed JavaScript hackjob using [`whatsapp-web.js`](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js).
No API keys, no business accounts, no OAuth drama. Just run the
code, scan the QR like it’s 2016, and boom; bot’s in your WhatsApp
like spyware.

## 📦 Dependencies?
Yeah, `puppeteer` is here. I hate it too. But when the choice is
"browser automation hell" or "missing another game," I pick the
demon I can wrangle in 15 minutes.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon (maybe)

Next up: player rating and team balancing. After each match,
players will vote on who played like a pro and who just ran
`htop`on the field. Rankings will help auto-sort fair teams,
so the games stop feeling like 10v1 benchmarks.


## ⚠️ Legal-ish Stuff
This probably violates WhatsApp’s TOS. Cry me a river. I don’t like
them either.  
Use it at your own risk, and try not to brag too loudly when it
works better than any Meta product ever will.
